### Experiment and Outcomes
Any process of observation is called an **experiment**. The results of an observation are called the **outcomes** of the experiment.

### Random Experiement
An experiment in which **the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty**. An experiment is called a random experiment if its outcome cannot be predicted.

For example, A customer will buy a product or not, 
             The result of a cricket match ( win, lose or draw )

### Sample Space
The set of all the possible outcomes of a random experiment is called sample space. It is denoted by S.

Example: Outcome of the cricket match: Sample Space S = { Win, Lose, Draw }

Example: Predict customer will buy insurance: Sample Space S = { Buy, Not Buy }

Example: Predict the percentage of customer churn: Sample Space S = { 0 <= X <= 100 }

### Event
Event(E) is a subset of a sample space. Probability is calculated with respect to an event.

Event A: The number of returns of orders placed at an eCommerce company exceeding 5%
Event B: The number of insurance claims rejected by the company is less than 10%

### Algebra of Events
Assume X, Y, and Z are the three events of a sample space.

**Commutative rule:** $X \cup Y$ = $Y \cup X$ and $X \cap Y$ =  $Y \cap X$

**Associative rule:** ($X \cup Y) \cup Z$ =  

### Probability of Event

- For any event **A**, the probability of the complementary event **${ \acute{A} }$** is given by
